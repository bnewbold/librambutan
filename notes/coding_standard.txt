libmaple Coding Standards
=========================

Author: Marti Bolivar (mbolivar@leaflabs.com)

LeafLabs team members are required to follow these when producing new
code.  Community contributors to libmaple are strongly encouraged to
do so; following these rules will greatly increase the probability
that your patches will be folded in.

In general, do it like this unless there's a really good reason why
not.  You being lazy doesn't count as a good reason.  Most, if not
all, of these decisions are entirely arbitrary, but it's important for
readability that we be consistent.

The file .dir-locals.el in the libmaple root directory already ensures
that many of these standards are followed by default in Emacs (but not
on Windows, where it would need to be named _dir_locals.el, and no
way, man).  There's also some elisp scattered about this file which
will provide you additional help.

Vim customizations to do the same thing would be nice (hint, hint)!

License
-------

- Put an MIT license at the beginning of the file (look at any of our
  source files for an example).  Copyright should go to either you or
  LeafLabs LLC.

  Emacs: if you don't like seeing the license, you should use
  elide-head (which will hide it for you).  Here is some elisp you can
  modify to make this pleasant:

    (require 'elide-head)
    (setq programming-mode-hooks '(c-mode-hook c++-mode-hook))
    (add-to-list 'elide-head-headers-to-hide
                 '("The MIT License" . "DEALINGS IN\n [*] THE SOFTWARE"))
    (add-to-list 'elide-head-headers-to-hide
                 '("The MIT License" . "DEALINGS IN THE\n...SOFTWARE"))
    (dolist (hook mbolivar-programming-mode-hooks)
      (add-hook hook (lambda () (elide-head))))

Whitespace/Indentation
----------------------

- 4 space indents.  [Set in .dir-locals.el]

- Unix newlines.

- No tab characters. [Set in .dir-locals.el]

- No trailing whitespace.  For help getting this (and no tab
  characters) done automatically in Emacs, you can use this:

    http://github.com/mbolivar/code-fascism

  I hear tell you can get something similar in vim; ask around, I
  guess.

- Files end in exactly one newline. [The presence of a newline at EOF
  is already done by `c-require-final-newline' in recent versions of
  Emacs.]

- Exactly two newlines separate source paragraphs (you do separate
  your code into paragraphs, don't you?).

- The first line in a function is non-blank.

- Don't indent C code within a conditionally-compiled extern "C"
  block.  Emacs does this by default, which can be very annoying; you
  can turn this behavior off with

        (defun c-mode-inextern-lang-hook ()
          (setcdr (assq 'inextern-lang c-offsets-alist) '-))

        (add-hook 'c-mode-hook c-mode-inextern-lang-hook)


Comments
--------

- Multi-line comments look like this:

    /* text starts here
     * continued lines have a '*' before them
     * the comment can end after the last line
     */

  or this:

    /* comment starts here
     * the comment can end on the same line */

- Doxygen comments are newline comments that begin with /** instead.
  It is not required that the "/**" appear on a line by itself.

- Single-line comments on the same line are // in c or c++.

- Single-line comments on their own source line are /* */ in c, but
  can also be // in c++.  If you think that typing out /* */ is too
  slow in emacs, use M-; (comment-dwim) when you're on an empty line,
  and it'll ... well...

      You should be using the (super awesome) comment-dwim; it pretty
      much does exactly what you want to the comment on the current
      line, including "create one and put it in the right place".

Naming conventions
------------------

- There's always a fight about upper and lower case vs. underscores.
  We'll handle this as follows.

  First, Dammit_Dont_Mix_Like_This, because It_Looks_Really_Ugly, ok?
  [There's been some debate about this, and some exceptions are
  already grandfathered in, so in order to settle it, let's call this
  a "recommendation" instead of "requirement".]

- Variables: Use underscores to separate words in C identifiers:

    int some_example_name;

  It is strongly advised to do it this way in C++ too, but it's not
  [yet] mandatory.

- Classes: Pascal case.  So ThisIsAClassName, but thisIsNot,
  this_is_not, and like I said, Dont_You_DareTryANYTHING_STUPID.

- Functions: C functions are all lowercase, and words are separated by
  underscores.  C++ method names are camel cased (thisIsAnExample).

- Structs: pick a style from "Variables" or "Classes" depending on how
  you mean it (since it might be either a simple record type, in which
  case do like c variables, or you might be faking an object in c, in
  which case do like classes).  If it's in a typedef, don't feel
  obliged to put "_t" at the end of the name; we don't.

- Macros and constants: all caps, separated by underscores.  Variables
  with the "const" qualifier aren't considered "constants" for the
  purposes of this rule; i.e., case them according to the rules for
  variables.

- foo.h gets #ifdef'ed to _FOO_H_.

- Acronyms: The case of letters in an acronym is determined by the
  case of the first letter in the acronym, which is determined by
  following the above rules.  Examples:

      void usb_func() { ... }

      class SomethingUSB {
          void usbInit();
          void initUSB();
      };

  Never do this:

      class BadUsb { ... }; // say "GoodUSB" instead

Documentation
-------------

- Document your code.  This should go without saying.

- For complicated peripherals, it would be nice if you put longer-form
  comments into this directory (notes/), with a comment in the
  corresponding .h file referring to it.  See libmaple/dac.h for an
  example.  That lets us keep the source files relatively clean while
  still allowing new readers to have a starting point.

- At least put a doxygen comment with a nonempty @brief for every .h
  file you add.  See the existing ones for examples.  For now, it'd be
  better if you didn't put a @brief into any .c[pp] files, since it
  (currently) interferes with our documentation generator in a way
  that I won't explain here (though you can look into the LeafLabs or
  michaeljones breathe repos on github and potentially figure out
  why).

- Doxygen comments generally just belong on types, functions,
  etc. that are part of the public user-facing API.  This generally
  means that if there's ReST documentation for it under docs/source/,
  it needs Doxygen comments, and that ReST should use Breathe to pull
  that Doxygen comment out. (For more info on this, see docs/README).

  There are some exceptions to this rule since Breathe isn't totally
  mature yet and Sphinx's C++ domain is still in flux.  In these
  cases, document the code "manually" in ReST.

  This should be avoided if at all possible, since it creates a
  maintenance burden of documenting things in two places at once, and
  provides an opportunity for bad documentation to slip in, when the
  code comments fall out of sync with the ReST docs.

General Formatting
------------------

- Keep it 80-column clean.  That means Emacs says the largest column
  number=79.  If you haven't already, you should turn on column
  numbers to help you out:

    (column-number-mode 1)

  You can get more help from lineker-mode.  Download it here:

    http://www.helsinki.fi/~sjpaavol/programs/lineker.el

  Then put the file somewhere in your load-path, and:

    (require 'lineker)
    (dolist (hook '(c-mode-hook c++-mode-hook))
      (add-hook hook (lambda () (lineker-mode 1))))

  There are only a few exceptional situations.  The most important one
  is when specifying a lookup table like PIN_MAP where it'd be ugly to
  split each entry over multiple lines.
