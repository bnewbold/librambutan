 Built-in Types
================

This document serves as a reference for many of the built-in types
which are available when programming in the IDE.  Programmers using
the :ref:`command-line tools <unix-toolchain>` will have access to
these types as long as they have imported `wirish.h
<https://github.com/leaflabs/libmaple/blob/master/wirish/wirish.h>`_;
several are defined in in `libmaple_types.h
<https://github.com/leaflabs/libmaple/blob/master/libmaple/libmaple_types.h>`_.
