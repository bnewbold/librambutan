Maple Documentation Index
=========================

Welcome!  This is the Maple documentation index.  It contains
tutorials, quickstarts, and technical documentation.

If you just got a new Maple, you probably want to begin with the
:ref:`quickstart <maple-quickstart>`.  You can then move on to reading
about the programming language you use with the Maple at the
:ref:`language reference <language>`.

If you're having problems, you might want to visit the
:ref:`troubleshooting <troubleshooting>` and :ref:`known problems
<errata>` pages.  Finally, you can always hit the `forums
<http://forums.leaflabs.com/>`_ to ask questions to the LeafLabs team
and other Maple users.  Good luck, and have fun!
