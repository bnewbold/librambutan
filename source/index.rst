Maple Documentation Index
=========================

Welcome!  This is the documentation index for programming your Maple.
It contains tutorials, quickstarts, and technical documentation.

If you just got a new Maple, you probably want to begin with the
:ref:`quickstart <maple-quickstart>`.  You can then move on to reading
about the programming language you use with the Maple at the
:ref:`language reference <language>`.  Good luck, and have fun!
