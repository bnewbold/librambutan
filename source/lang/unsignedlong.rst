``unsigned long``
=================

An unsigned version of the :ref:`long <lang-long>` data type.  An
``unsigned long`` occupies 8 bytes of memory; it stores an integer
from 0 to 2^64-1, which is approximately 1.8Ã—10^19 (18 quintillion, or
18 billion billion).

Like an :ref:`unsigned int <lang-unsignedint>`, an ``unsigned long``
won't store negative numbers; it is also subject to the same
:ref:`overflow issues <lang-int-overflow>` as any integral data type.

Here is an example of declaring an ``unsigned long`` variable named
``c``, then giving it value 299,792,458,000,000,000 (see :ref:`integer
constants <lang-constants-integers-u-l>` for an explanation of the "L"
at the end of the number)::

        // Speed of light in nanometers per second (approximate).
        unsigned long c = 299792458000000000L;

The general syntax for declaring an ``unsigned long`` variable named
``var``, then giving it value ``val``, looks like::

        unsigned long var = val;
