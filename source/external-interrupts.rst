External Interrupts
===================

External interrupts can be used to make a voltage change on a pin
cause a function to be called.  Each :ref:`GPIO pin <gpio>` can be
used to detect transitions, such as when the voltage goes from
:ref:`LOW <lang-constants-low>` to :ref:`HIGH <lang-constants-high>`,
or from ``HIGH`` to ``LOW``. This can be used to avoid checking for
changes on a pin "manually" by waiting in a loop until the pin
changes.

Overview
--------

External interrupts are often used to detect when events happen
outside of the Maple. These can be used to tell Maple when events
happen, such as when a sensor has data ready to be read, or when a
button has been pushed.  When such an event happens, an interrupt is
raised, and the Maple stops whatever it was doing to react to it by
calling a function (called an *interrupt handler*) which you specify
using :ref:`lang-attachinterrupt`.

.. _external-interrupts-exti-line:

Every pin can generate an external interrupt, but there are some
restrictions.  At most 16 different external interrupts can be used at
one time.  Further, you can't just pick any 16 pins to use.  This is
because every pin on the Maple connects to what is called an *EXTI
line*, and only one pin per EXTI line can be used for external
interrupts at a time [#fextisports]_.

.. TODO [0.0.12] Maple Native links

The EXTI Line Pin Map for your board lists which pins connect to which
EXTI lines:

* :ref:`Maple <maple-exti-map>`
* :ref:`Maple RET6 Edition <maple-ret6-exti-map>`
* :ref:`Maple Mini <maple-mini-exti-map>`

.. note::

   You should set the :ref:`pin mode <lang-pinmode>` of your desired
   pin to an input mode (e.g. ``INPUT``, ``INPUT_PULLUP``,
   ``INPUT_PULLDOWN``).

.. [#fextisports] The underlying reason for this restriction is that
   the external interrupt lines on the STM32 are shared between
   :ref:`GPIO ports <gpio-ports>`.  There can be only one external
   interrupt on each GPIO bit, out of all of the ports.  That is, if
   PA4 has an external interrupt on it, then PB4 can't have one, too.
   Since the GPIO bit numbers only go from 0 to 15, there can only be
   16 external interrupts at a time.
