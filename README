General information
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A HOWTO on setting up this library for use in a Unix environment is
available in our online HTML documentation:

    http://leaflabs.com/docs/unix-toolchain.html

The HTML docs for this repository are automatically generated from the
source code and the files under the top-level /docs/ directory.  For
more information, see /docs/README.

Our bugtracker is available at:

Repository Layout
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

/build/

    Compiler output

/contrib/

    Community-contributed resources.  LeafLabs doesn't maintain the
    contents of this directory, so it may get stale.

/docs/

    Source code and build scripts for Doxygen and Sphinx
    documentation.  The libmaple HTML documentation is generated from
    these files.  It is available under http://leaflabs.com/docs/.

/examples/

    Example code and test programs. Copy these to /main.cpp to compile them.

/libmaple/

    Lowest level definitions, routines, macros, and functions. This is
    the meat of the library.  The Arduino-like compatibility layer is
    in /wirish/.

/libraries/

    Special-purpose libraries that don't merit inclusion in the
    /libmaple/ and /wirish/ directories, which are intended for
    general use.  Arduino-compatible libraries go here.

/LICENSE

    Licensing and copyright information.

/main.cpp.example

    main.cpp is required for a successful build but is non-existent by
    default; use this file as a template for building your program. By
    default, just blinks an LED.

/Makefile

    libmaple build instructions for GNU Make.

/notes/

    Unstructured text notes that may be useful.

/README

    This file.

/support/

    Support files and scripts for various purposes.

    gdb/              GDB scripts.
    ld/               Linker scripts.
    make/             Additional scripts used by the top-level Makefile.
    openocd/          OpenOCD scripts for JTAG debugging.
    scripts/          Miscellany.
    stm32loader.py    Script for uploading via the built-in USART bootloader.

/wirish/

    Extra wrappers and functionality around the lower level code in
    /libmaple/. These files implement an Arduino "Wiring"-like
    library.
